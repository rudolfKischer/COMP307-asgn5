            I love to play and explore the world of videogames.
             I am also really interested in analyzing games. 
             How the design, mechanics , narative and art come together to create an experience is fascinating to me.
             Below are some of my favourite titles and some I have been playing recently.

        <div id ='skiingDescription'>
            I have been skiing since I could walk. 
            I grew up skiing on whistler blackomb in B.C.
            Skiing allows me to enjoy the outdoors and spend time with friends during the winter.

        <div id='description'> 
            Growing up on the coast I learnt to sail with my brothers.
            We often only sail small boats by the sailing club.
            Sometimes during the summer we get the chance to go on sailing trips.

        <div id='rowingDescription'>
            I learnt how to row during highschool.
            Sometimes the sport is called skulling or crew.
            It is very physicaly requiring sport that also demands teamwork.
            I usually rowed  in doubles or quads. Often my position was bow.
            The club I rowed out of was the Vancouver Rowing Club.

        <div id='paintingDescription'>
            Sometimes when I am stressed I paint to chillout. 
            I find painting quite cathartic and satisfying.
            Sometimes I paint with my roomates or friends.
            My work is pretty amateur but here it is below if you would like to see it.
